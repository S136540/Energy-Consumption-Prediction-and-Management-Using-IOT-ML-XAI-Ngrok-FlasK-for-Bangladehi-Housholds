 Efficient energy management for household appliances is crucial for maximizing domestic
 energy use and facilitating proactive maintenance. Recent researches indicate that traditional forecasting
 approaches frequently lack the precision and real-time capabilities essential for effective household energy
 management. This paper provides a holistic method that combines IoT data gathering, machine learning
 (ML) and Explainable AI (XAI) to improve the precision and comprehensibility of energy consumption
 forecasts in residential buildings. Among the 18 models that were assessed, polynomial regression was
 identified as the most efficient choice for this particular assignment. Non-invasive sensors are used to capture
 data effortlessly, and real-time monitoring is accomplished through a web application built on Flask, with
 remote access facilitated by Ngrok. The predictive model, augmented by Physics-Informed Neural Networks
 (PINNs), ensures that predictions are consistent with physical laws. The system’s performance is rigorously
 evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean
 Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and the Coefficient of Determination (R²), achieving superior results
 with an RMSE of 0.03, MAE of 0.02, MAPE of 0.04, and an R² of 0.9989. XAI techniques, including
 SHAP and LIME, are employed to explain the model’s predictions, providing insights into the factors
 influencing household energy consumption. This research establishes a new benchmark for residential
 energy management, offering a scalable, interpretable, and highly accurate solution for real-time energy
 optimization and predictive maintenance in household environments.
